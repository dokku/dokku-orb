  Your dokku host may be behind a firewall, in which case you might want to
  whitelist the IP of the builder prior to using the commands exposed through
  this orb. Though this orb does not include any commands or jobs specific to
  IP whitelisting, this can be accomplished using other third party orbs.
  Consider the example below for inspiration.

usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    dokku: dokku/dokku@0.3.0
    ip-address-helper: dokku/ip-address-helper@1.0.0
  workflows:
    deploy:
      jobs:
        - checkout
        # See implementation of this orb - it is just a convenient way of grabbing the externally facing IP address of the builder
        - ip-address-helper/set-env-var
        - run:
            name: Whitelist the IP
            command: |
              # TODO use an API to whitelist IP - e.g AWS, DigitalOcean, Scaleway etc have API's for adding the IP to a security group.

        - add_ssh_keys:
            fingerprints:
              - "SO:ME:FIN:G:ER:PR:IN:T"

        - dokku/deploy:
            git-remote-url: ssh://dokku@dokku.myhost.ca:22/appname

        - run:
            name: Remove the IP
            command: |
              # TODO use an API to remove the IP
            when: always # this line ensures this will still be run even if the job fails for some reason
