  This example uses a job unique to this configuration, in which the commands
  exposed by this orb are used. This allows for easily e.g running one-off commands
  as part of the deploy process within the same job.

usage:
  version: 2.1

  orbs:
    dokku: dokku/dokku@0.3.0

  jobs:
    deploy:
      executor: dokku/default
      steps:
        - checkout
        - add_ssh_keys:
            fingerprints:
              - "SO:ME:FIN:G:ER:PR:IN:T"
        - dokku/ssh-setup:
            host: my-dokku-host.io
        - dokku/git-deploy:
            host: my-dokku-host.io
            app: my-dokku-app
        - dokku/app-run:
            host: my-dokku-host.io
            app: my-dokku-app
            command: bundle exec rails db:migrate
